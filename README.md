# Lua Game Helpers #

This is a simple game utility library containing a large amount of functions used in most of my Lua based games. The library should work with DaisyMoon as well as LÃ–VE2D by default. Small changes will have to be made to certain functions since they require a reference to a designated framework call. These can be specified and easily modified in the given files.
